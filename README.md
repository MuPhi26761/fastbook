This repository contains my notes, homework, and projects from the [Fast.ai Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, experiment with the `fastai` library, and implement state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The coursework is divided by lessons, with a mix of replicated course notebooks and my own independent experiments.

| Lesson | Topic | My Notebook | Project/Experiment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | Image Classification | [Link](./01_intro.ipynb) | *Is it a Bird?* Classifier |

## 🌟 Project Highlights

### 1. The Bear Classifier (Lesson 2)
*A computer vision model capable of distinguishing between Grizzly, Black, and Teddy bears.*
* **Accuracy:** 98%
* **Data:** Scraped using DuckDuckGo Search API.
* **Live Demo:** [Click Here to Try it on HuggingFace Spaces](YOUR_LINK_HERE)
* **Key Learning:** How to clean data using the `ImageClassifierCleaner` and deploy a `.pkl` model.

### 2. Multi-Label Classification (Lesson 6)
*[Insert Screenshot of results here]*
* **Goal:** Identifying multiple attributes in a single satellite image.
* **Architecture:** ResNet50
* **Key Learning:** Understanding metrics for multi-label problems (F1 Score vs. Accuracy).
